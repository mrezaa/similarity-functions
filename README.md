# Project Title

Similarity function execution time 

## Description

Similarity function execution speed is analyzed based on Cosine function with different calculations scenarios. Also, Jaccard method is compared to them. 
For cosine similarity, we have simple calculation, dot product version and also dot product from Numpy library. Execution time is averaged over some number
of iterations and final results for different mehtods are compared graphically through some figures.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Code is written by jupyter notebook on Win10
* Required libraries are listed in first code segment

### Installing

* To have a copy of code and other materials you can clone at: https://github.com/mrezaa/similarity-functions.git

### Executing program

* In jupyter notebook every code segment is easily executed with shift+Enter
* In other python interpreters you can use .py version
